        'The email arrives in your inbox: "IEP Meeting Scheduled for [Child\'s Name]." Your stomach drops a little. You\'ve heard the term "IEP meeting" thrown around, maybe from other parents or your child\'s teacher, but you\'re not entirely sure what it means or what you\'re supposed to do to get ready.',
        'Should you prepare something? What if they ask you questions you can\'t answer? What if you agree to something that\'s not right for your child because you didn\'t know enough to push back?',
        'I\'ve sat on both sides of that table, as the speech-language pathologist facilitating IEP meetings and as the educational advocate helping families prepare for them. And here\'s what I know: The parents who feel most confident in their first IEP meeting aren\'t the ones who\'ve memorized special education law. They\'re the ones who did a few simple things to prepare.',
        'Let me show you exactly what to do in the days leading up to your meeting, so you can walk into that room feeling ready instead of anxious.',

                'What I recommend: As soon as you receive the meeting invitation, call or email the special education coordinator and say: "I\'d like to receive copies of all evaluation reports as soon as they\'re available. I know I\'m entitled to them at least three school days before the meeting, but having extra time to review them would really help me prepare."',
                'Most schools will accommodate this request - they want parents to come prepared too. But if they push back, know that three school days before the meeting is your legal right.',
                'Why does this matter? Because if you\'re seeing test scores and recommendations for the first time just days before the meeting, you\'re scrambling to process information instead of asking questions. When you have the reports earlier, you can show up with a thoughtful list of things you want clarified or concerns you want addressed.',
